Objects and Classes
An instance of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) consists of depots, vehicles and clients.

Each vehicle belongs to a single depot. It starts from there and it may return there at any time.
Each client has a name and a visiting time interval.
Each vehicle will perform a single tour, starting from its depot, visiting a number of clients, and ending in the same depot.
We consider the problem of allocating clients to vehicles, such that all clients are visited (if possible).

The main specifications of the application are:

Create an object-oriented model of the problem. You should have (at least) the following classes: Depot, Vehicle, Client.
A client may be of two types, regular and premium. Use an enum in order to implement this feature.
Each class should have appropriate constructors, getters and setters.
Use the IDE features for code generation, such as generating getters and setters.
The toString method form the Object class must be properly overridden for all the classes.
Use the IDE features for code generation, for example (in NetBeans) press Alt+Ins or invoke the context menu, select "Insert Code" and then "toString()" (or simply start typing "toString" and then press Ctrl+Space).
Create and print on the screen an object of each class.

Create classes that describe the problem and its solution.
